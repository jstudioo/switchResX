# Fixing switchResx saving issue

Recently I bought a ultra-wide monitor which a really weird but useful 21:9 aspect ratio.The only way mac would support this if i get a mini displayport to displayport adapter.

Since some orders take weeks for souq to fullfil.I decided to the use the single DVI cable from my older monitor on the new one.Once I plugged it in I faced the same issue the mac would only render only upto Full HD or 1920 X 1080.After a quick googling I found that SwitchResX can solve this issue.

But for some reason every time I create a custom resolution of 2560 X 1080,SwitchResX would not save it and if it did it would say not installed.I tried this a couple of times.I even deleted all the SwitchResX files and even uninstall SwitchResX from the menu bar.

Even setting the resolution was really  difficult, after rebooting a couple of times I finally got it working with the following settings.

To get SwitchResX to save the settings.Follow the instructions in these instructions:

- Create a new user on the mac
- Install the SwitchResX application,this will start the 10 days trial.
- Create the resolution profile and save it.
- It should prompt you to reboot the mac.Please do so.

And Voila the resolution is should now present on your original userâ€™s SwitchResX.Now you can select it in the current resolution tab.
